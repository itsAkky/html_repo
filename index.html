        <p>All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).</p>
        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
